# Rock, Paper, Scissor Challenge Assessment

### Provided are two separate project versions of the assessment.

**SIM:** The assessment version of the game. The user has no input. 100 games are simulated between two players. Player A always chooses Paper. Player B chooses randomly between Rock, Paper, and Scissors. The game displays how many times each player won as well as the amount of ties that occurred. Scores are tallied after the result with the player who won the most games out of 100 gaining 1 point.

**GAME:** An actual game of User vs. Computer Rock, Paper, Scissor. User plays against a cpu which will randomly choose between Rock, Paper, and Scissor. The winner of the result gains a point which is tallied and tracked.

I have provided both the Java project src files as well as a runnable .jar file for both versions of the assessment.
